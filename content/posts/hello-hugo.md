This site now runs on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The source lives in this repository and publishes automatically through GitHub Pages. Explore the repo structure, update `config.toml` with your preferences, and create new posts with `hugo new posts/my-next-post.md`.

When you're ready to preview, run `hugo server` for live reload. The deployment workflow builds the site on `main` and publishes it to the `gh-pages` branch.
